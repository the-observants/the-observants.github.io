            <p class="body">My life right now is chaos. I've been trying to recuperate my life from my friends, family. My family right now hates me for what? Because they think
                I'm a DRUG DEALER my mom calls me drug addict every second even though I do not smoke weed anymore. There's a fucking A.I. above my city because... I do not know.
                I gave up being a spy 30,000 years ago and now I have to go around being the what? "sucked on sock" or whatever deadmau5 wants me to be. Guess what? I learnt that
                the A.I. above my house, hex by the way, helped me get into MAU5TRAP o wow how amazing... where is my boss? Why isn't he here? Do I really need fucking rehab? Bullshit
                none of my friends are here... my boss, Bruce Green, I do not know what they are doing... Yeah... umm whatever this A.I. is doing I'm not gonna follow... because well...
                the obvious answer is that these people are going to call me nut jobs... I know people have their jobs... so then take fucking hex away... I've had it. Ava Max is my girlfriend
                and also every fucking celebrity I can think off... "Fucking cool for the summer" thats what I say every time. I'd rather kill myself than keep on going.
                <br>
                PS: I'm the contractor "Nobody knows of.."

            <p class="body">Day 2 of not giving a fuck about anything. I still do not have any news from deadmau5 knowing that he listens to me through fucking hex the mf that is not
                helping me in my life. I met my PR manager months ago, and no word of him... no phone number and no one helping me... I do not care about my friends right now. I'm starting to feel
                more depressed every day and no one ever cares. I heard someone being an astract and i hate people like that, I cannot believe these people. I do not care about them being lessed they
                deserve it each an everyone of them UNLESS i've met them clearly I just want people to understand that this is not a way of life... its horrible HORRIBLE.
