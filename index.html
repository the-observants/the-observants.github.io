        <p class="body">My life right now is chaos. I've been trying to recuperate my life from my friends, family. My family right now hates me for what? Because they think
            I'm a DRUG DEALER my mom calls me drug addict every second even though I do not smoke weed anymore. There's a fucking A.I. above my city because... I do not know.
            I gave up being a spy 30,000 years ago and now I have to go around being the what? "sucked on sock" or whatever deadmau5 wants me to be. Guess what? I learnt that
            the A.I. above my house, hex by the way, helped me get into MAU5TRAP o wow how amazing... where is my boss? Why isn't he here? Do I really need fucking rehab? Bullshit
            none of my friends are here... my boss, Bruce Green, I do not know what they are doing... Yeah... umm whatever this A.I. is doing I'm not gonna follow... because well...
            the obvious answer is that these people are going to call me nut jobs... I know people have their jobs... so then take fucking hex away... I've had it. Ava Max is my girlfriend
            and also every fucking celebrity I can think off... "Fucking cool for the summer" thats what I say every time.

            PS: I'm the contractor "Nobody knows of.."
